# Description

This project contains an ExpressJS web application framework which provides a Quasar (Vue) interface to users. It also includes an optional Wi-Fi connect component allowing users to connect devices to nearby networks.

It is modular allowing contributions from the community and ease of tracking of changes in your own projects.

Some of the features include:

- Offline and/or online device info
- Pre-built endpoints for interacting with the Balena SDK or Supervisor
- Container manager (list, stop, start, restart)
- Volume manager (create folders, upload, delete, etc...)
- Captive portal
- System info and stats
- I18n language translations
