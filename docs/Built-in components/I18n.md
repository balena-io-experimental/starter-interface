## Add or edit languages

Support is included for multiple languages (i18n), and language strings are set in `/ui/src/i18n`.

To insert or remove languages you can see an example in [this commit](https://github.com/balena-labs-research/starter-interface/commit/c474241e25fe0cbcd46ced0caf4ac61138b60c1e).

## Contribute a translation

I18n language files used in this repository are managed by Weblate. If you are able to contribute a language to this repository, or improve a string you can edit entries or contribute new translations [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/learners-block/balena-device-ui/).
